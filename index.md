Walk from terminal 5 through "Sky City" and past terminal 4. Look for a black van with plate no FAJ 36C. Parking is already paid, just insert the receipt when exiting the parking.


Starting the car
----------------

The car has "keyless start", so ithe key only needs to be inside the car. The gear knob must to be in "P" mode when starting/stopping. Hold down the break pedal and press the start/stop button to start the car. Turn the knob to "R" for reverse or "D" for drive. It takes Diesel as you know.

Our home is at Odelbergsv√§gen 36, Enskede G√•rd:

Our home
----------------

We made the beds with clean sheets for you.
In the bathroom we put out towels for you also.

The WiFi is called "BigHero6" with password "oriavehl".

The trash room is located in the opposite building, to the right of the entrance.

We left a cooler in the hallway which connects to the car cigarette outlet in case you go for a picnic.
We also left frisbee discs and a screwdriver to adjust height of bike saddles.


Exploring our neighborhood
----------------------------

There are bikes in the bike storage next to the parking if you want to borrow - use the apartment key to get in. We only have five bikes though. Code for the code locks is 5736.

We also have a Vespa if you feel adventurous.
Bike keys and Vespa key is in the basket up to your right when you enter the apartment.
