Soon your trip is starting, we wish you a safe journey to our home town!

## Finding the car

The car is [parked in P21](https://goo.gl/maps/zGuNXZYX5e2E3qzM8) in ground level (marked level 1).

![FAJ 36C](./car.jpg)

Walk from terminal 5 through "Sky City" and past terminal 4. Look for a black van with plate no FAJ 36C. Parking is already paid, just insert the receipt when exiting the parking.

## Starting the car

The car has "keyless start", so ithe key only needs to be inside the car. The gear knob must to be in "P" mode when starting/stopping. Hold down the break pedal and press the start/stop button to start the car. Turn the knob to "R" for reverse or "D" for drive. It takes diesel as you know.

## Getting to our home

Our home is at [Odelbergsv√§gen 36](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MnZXymbNVhaMEpsV7).
It's a 40 min drive, here are rough directions:

- Take E4 towards Stockholm
- After 45 km, take exit 155 towards Nyn√§shamn
- After 4 km, take exit 73 towards Nyn√§shamn
- After 1 km, take Globen exit
- Turn right onto Enskedev√§gen
- After 1 km, turn right onto Palmfeltsv√§gen
- Turn left onto Odelbergsv√§gen

[The parking](https://goo.gl/maps/fkrwBh6w8dX17yF3A) is behind the opposite building, no 34.
Our parking lot is no 3.


## Our home

The main entrance opens with the apartment key, the plastic "blip" or by code 1425 (code works until 22:00).

We made the beds with clean sheets for you.
In the bathroom we put out towels for you also.

The WiFi is called "BigHero6" with password "oriavehl".

The trash room is located in the opposite building, to the right of the entrance. Use the apartment key to get in.

We left a cooler in the hallway which connects to the car cigarette outlet - could be useful on your trip to Gothenburg perhaps.

We also left frisbee discs and a screwdriver to adjust height of bike saddles.

The washing machine has "i-DOS" meaning it doses detergent automatically.
Refill with liquid detergent and make sure the "i-DOS" is lit on the display when starting a washing programme.

## Bikes and Vespa

There are bikes in the bike storage next to the parking if you want to borrow - use the apartment key to get in. We only have five bikes though. Code for the code locks is 5736.

We also have a Vespa if you feel adventurous (it's the one with the XLMOTO cover).
Bike keys and Vespa key is in the basket up to your right when you enter the apartment.
